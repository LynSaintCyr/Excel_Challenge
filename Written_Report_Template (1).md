####### Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project		

	For this project Louise wanted to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their lunch dates and their funding goals. For this assignment I had to use the skills that I learned Sure from seeing the Kickstarter worksheet in module 1 to first analyze Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart and later analyze Outcomes Based on Based on Goals Chart. The purpose of this assignment is to exercise the skills that I have learned from module 1 to create two new analyses.


### Analysis and Challenges
To analyze outcomes based on launch date I had to create a new column in the Kickstarter workbook labeled “Year” I then proceeded use the year function to extract the year from the “date created conversion” column. I then I created a pivot table in a brand-new sheet called “theater outcomes by launch date.” In the new sheet I filtered the pivot table based on “Parent Category” and “Years” I didn't filter the column labels to show only “successful” “failed” and “cancelled” I filter the parent category to show only data for theater. Lastly, I created a graph from the pivot table to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch months. For this first deliverable I faced no challenges everything was very clear. For the second deliverable I had to use the Kickstarter worksheet to analyze outcomes based on goals. In a new worksheet I created a column with 8 different labels; Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled. In the gold column are you a dollar my Rangers so the project can be grouped based on their goal amount and then I use the countifs function find the number successful, number failed, and number cancelled for each different ranges by filtering the Kickstarter outcome column. After I used the Sum function and total projects for each different range. Then I proceeded to use the round if formula to find the percentage successful, failed, and cancelled I created a line chart based on those outcomes. The most challenging part about this deliverable to me was trying to find which formula to use for finding the percentages for successful, failed, and cancelled. 
 



## Results


	For one the highest number of successful theater projects were in May and June and the lowest were in December. The highest number of theater projects were May, and the highest number of cancelled theater projects were in January. Out of a total 1369 theater projects 839 were successful, 493 failed, and only 37 were cancelled. For outcomes based on goal range 1000 to 4999 had the highest successful plays, failed plays, and canceled plays. Some other possible tables and graphs that we can create from this workbook are column or bar chart, and last but not least a scatter chart.
